---

## Development Timeline

### Initial Setup (Day 1)
- **Renamed project** from "Shakespeare LLM" to "Hotspur" 
- **Updated vision**: From text generator → scholarly assistant
- **Reorganized project structure** into logical directories:
  - `hotspur_search/` - Search component
  - `scripts/` - Data processing utilities  
  - `examples/` - Demo scripts
  - `tests/` - Test scripts
  - `archive/` - Older versions
  - `docs/` - Comprehensive documentation

### Search Component Development (Day 1-2)

#### 1. Architecture Design
**Selected Tech Stack**:
- **Whoosh**: Pure Python search engine (chosen over Elasticsearch for simplicity)
- **Streamlit**: Web interface (rapid prototyping, scholar-friendly)
- **Python**: Core parsing and indexing

#### 2. Component Implementation

**Parser Development** (`hotspur_search/utils/shakespeare_parser.py`):
- Intelligent text segmentation with context windows
- Play vs. sonnet detection
- Act/scene/speaker extraction
- Metadata preservation

**Search Engine** (`hotspur_search/utils/search_engine.py`):
- Full-text search with multiple query types:
  - Word search
  - Exact phrase matching  
  - Regular expressions
  - Fuzzy matching
- Work filtering capabilities
- Result highlighting and context display

**Web Interface** (`hotspur_search/streamlit_app/app.py`):
- Clean, scholar-friendly design
- Advanced search options sidebar
- Export functionality (CSV, JSON, TXT)
- Search history tracking
- Citation-ready formatting

#### 3. Critical Issues Encountered & Resolved

**Issue 1: Parser Not Detecting Individual Works**
- **Problem**: Parser treated entire corpus as "Shakespeare's Sonnets"
- **Root Cause**: Shakespeare file had table of contents at beginning (lines 1-40)
- **Solution**: Created `check_shakespeare_structure.py` to analyze file format
- **Fix**: Updated parser to skip TOC and detect work boundaries

**Issue 2: Famous Quotes Not Found**
- **Problem**: Search for "to be or not to be" returned empty
- **Investigation**: Created `diagnose_search.py` for systematic debugging
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. Old index still cached despite rebuild
  2. Exact text has punctuation: "To be, or not to be, that is the question"
- **Solution**: Force rebuild with `force_rebuild.py` + user education on exact matching

**Issue 3: Search Index Caching**
- **Problem**: Rebuilt index still showed old data
- **Solution**: Complete cleanup and rebuild process with module reloading

### Final Results

#### Successfully Implemented Features ✅
- **Complete corpus search**: 93,812 searchable text segments
- **31 Shakespeare works** properly separated and indexed
- **Multiple search types**: word, phrase, regex, fuzzy
- **Work filtering**: Search within specific plays
- **Context display**: Configurable surrounding lines (1-10)
- **Rich metadata**: Work titles, act/scene numbers, speakers, line numbers
- **Export functionality**: CSV, JSON, TXT formats
- **Citation support**: Academic-ready references
- **Performance**: Sub-second search response times
- **Web interface**: Intuitive Streamlit app

#### Key Metrics
- **Index size**: ~154 MB
- **Documents indexed**: 93,812 text segments  
- **Works available**: 31 plays and sonnet collections
- **Search speed**: <200ms for most queries
- **Memory usage**: ~50-100 MB for index

• "Romeo, Romeo" → Juliet's balcony scene
• "Friends, Romans, countrymen" → Mark Antony's speech
• love → All mentions across corpus
• crown (filtered to Hamlet) → Power themes in Hamlet
• love.*death (regex) → Lines with both concepts
```

1. **File format matters**: Always analyze source data structure before parsing
2. **Index caching**: Search engines can cache aggressively - force rebuilds when needed
3. **Exact vs fuzzy matching**: Punctuation significantly affects search results
4. **Context is crucial**: Surrounding lines make results much more useful for scholars

### Design Decisions That Worked
1. **Whoosh over Elasticsearch**: Simpler deployment, good enough performance
2. **Streamlit for POC**: Rapid development, good enough UX
3. **Structured segments**: Rich metadata enables powerful filtering
4. **Multiple export formats**: Serves different research workflows

### Process Improvements
1. **Diagnostic scripts**: Essential for debugging complex data pipelines
2. **Force rebuild capability**: Necessary when caching interferes
3. **Progressive testing**: Test at each stage rather than end-to-end only

### Post-Launch Bug Fix (Day 3)

#### Issue: Work Filtering Not Working
**Problem Discovered**: User reported that search worked fine with "All Works" selected, but returned empty results when filtering by specific works.

**Investigation Process**:
1. Created `debug_work_filtering.py` to systematically diagnose the issue
2. Found that basic searches worked (returning results from multiple works)
3. Discovered work-specific filters consistently returned 0 results
4. Identified root cause through step-by-step query analysis

**Root Cause Identified**:
- **Schema Design Flaw**: `work_title` field was defined as `TEXT` type in Whoosh schema
- **Tokenization Issue**: TEXT fields are tokenized, so "THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET" became separate searchable tokens
- **Matching Failure**: Exact string matching failed because index stored individual words, not complete titles

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Schema Fix**: Changed `work_title` from `TEXT(stored=True, field_boost=2.0)` to `ID(stored=True)`
2. **Index Rebuild**: Completely rebuilt search index with corrected schema
3. **Verification**: Tested work-specific filtering to confirm resolution

**Files Created for Bug Fix**:
- `debug_work_filtering.py` - Systematic diagnosis script
- `fix_work_filtering.py` - Automated fix implementation

**Technical Details**:
```python
# Before (broken)
work_title=TEXT(stored=True, field_boost=2.0)  # Tokenized field

# After (fixed)  
work_title=ID(stored=True)  # Exact matching field
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ "All Works" search continues to work
- ✅ Work-specific filtering now returns correct results
- ✅ All search types (word/phrase/regex/fuzzy) work with filtering
- ✅ Performance unaffected (still sub-second responses)

**User Impact**: Critical usability issue resolved - scholars can now search within specific plays as intended.
