## Bug #1: Work Filtering Returns Empty Results

### Issue Details
**Date Discovered**: Day 3 of development  
**Reported By**: User testing  
**Severity**: High (Core functionality broken)  

**Description**: Search worked correctly when "All Works" was selected, but returned zero results when filtering by specific works like "Hamlet" or "Romeo and Juliet".

### Investigation
**Diagnostic Tools Created**:
- `debug_work_filtering.py` - Systematic diagnosis script
- Step-by-step query analysis
- Index content inspection

**Findings**:
1. Basic search without filters worked correctly
2. Work-specific filters consistently returned 0 results  
3. Direct work title queries also failed
4. Combined text + work filter queries returned empty

### Root Cause Analysis
**Technical Issue**: Whoosh schema design flaw

**Details**:
- `work_title` field was defined as `TEXT` type
- TEXT fields are automatically tokenized by Whoosh
- "THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET" was stored as separate tokens: ["THE", "TRAGEDY", "OF", "ROMEO", "AND", "JULIET"]
- Exact string matching for filtering failed because the complete title wasn't stored as a single unit

**Code Location**: `hotspur_search/utils/search_engine.py:42`

**Problematic Code**:
```python
work_title=TEXT(stored=True, field_boost=2.0),  # Wrong field type
```

### Solution Implementation
**Fix Strategy**: Change field type and rebuild index

**Steps Taken**:
1. **Schema Correction**: Changed `work_title` from `TEXT` to `ID` field type
2. **Index Rebuild**: Completely rebuilt search index with corrected schema  
3. **Automated Fix**: Created `fix_work_filtering.py` for reproducible resolution

**Fixed Code**:
```python
work_title=ID(stored=True),  # Correct field type for exact matching
```

**Files Modified**:
- `hotspur_search/utils/search_engine.py` (schema definition)
- Search index completely rebuilt

**Files Created**:
- `debug_work_filtering.py` - Diagnosis script
- `fix_work_filtering.py` - Automated fix script

### Validation
**Test Cases Verified**:
- ✅ "All Works" search continues to work
- ✅ Work-specific filtering now returns correct results
- ✅ Multiple search types (word/phrase/regex/fuzzy) work with filtering  
- ✅ Performance unchanged (sub-second responses)
- ✅ All 31 works available for filtering

**Example Working Searches**:
```
• "love" filtered to "THE TRAGEDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET" → Returns results
• "crown" filtered to "THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK" → Returns results  
• "friends" filtered to "THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR" → Returns results
```

### Prevention
**Lessons Learned**:
1. **Field Type Selection**: Use `ID` for exact matching, `TEXT` for full-text search
2. **Schema Testing**: Test filtering logic during initial development
3. **User Testing**: Critical for discovering real-world usage issues

**Future Prevention**:
- Added verification in `verify_setup.py` to test work filtering
- Document field type choices in schema comments
- Include filtering tests in any future schema changes

## Bug Tracking Summary

| Bug # | Issue | Severity | Status | Resolution Date |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| #1 | Work filtering empty results | High | ✅ Fixed | Day 3 |

## Development Process Improvements

### Diagnostic Tools Added
As a result of this bug, we now have a comprehensive debugging toolkit:

1. **`debug_work_filtering.py`** - Specific work filtering diagnosis
2. **`diagnose_search.py`** - General search system debugging  
3. **`verify_setup.py`** - Complete system verification
4. **`force_rebuild.py`** - Nuclear option for corrupted systems

### Testing Strategy Enhanced
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component verification
- **Integration Testing**: Full pipeline validation
- **User Acceptance**: Real-world usage scenarios
- **Regression Testing**: Verify fixes don't break other features

### Quality Gates Established
Before any future releases:
1. ✅ All search types work (word/phrase/regex/fuzzy)
2. ✅ Work filtering functional for all 31 works  
3. ✅ Export functionality works (CSV/JSON/TXT)
4. ✅ Performance meets sub-second target
5. ✅ User interface responsive and intuitive

## Future Considerations

### Potential Issues to Monitor
1. **Performance**: As corpus grows, search speed may degrade
2. **Schema Changes**: Any future field additions must consider exact vs. tokenized matching
3. **Unicode Handling**: International characters in search queries
4. **Concurrent Users**: Multi-user access to search index

### Monitoring Strategy
- User feedback collection for search quality
- Performance monitoring for response times
- Error logging for failed searches
- Usage analytics for popular search patterns

This bug discovery and resolution process demonstrates the importance of real-world user testing and the value of systematic debugging approaches.
